## Dependencies

* iTop End-User Devices (`itop-endusers-devices`) needs to be enabled during setup

## Installation

Place the extension in the `extensions` folder of your iTop instance and run iTop setup again.
Be sure to enable the extension during setup.

## Configuration

After installation, it is possible to change some settings in the iTop configuration.

```php
/**
 * Modules specific settings
 */
$MyModuleSettings = array(
   'br-peripherals' => array (
      // update Contact of linked peripherals to the User of the workstation
      'update_contacts_from_workstation' => 'true',
      // update location of linked peripherals to the location of the workstation
      'update_locations_from_workstation' => 'true',
      // only available in conjunction with br-costcenter; update CostCenter of linked peripherals to the CostCenter of the workstation
      'update_costcenters_from_workstation' => 'true',
   ),
);
```

### update_contacts_from_workstation

Decide whether the user of a workstation should be added to the contacts of the assigned peripheral devices.

* `true`
* `false` (default)

### update_locations_from_workstation

Decide whether the location of peripheral devices assigned to a workstation should match the location of the workstation.

* `true`
* `false` (default)

### update_costcenters_from_workstation

Decide whether the cost center of peripheral devices assigned to a workstation should match the workstation's cost center.

Additionally, ensure that the iTop extension [iTop-br-costcenter](https://github.com/rudnerbjoern/iTop-br-costcenter) is installed for this functionality.

* `true`
* `false` (default)
